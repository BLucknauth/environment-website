			<p> Notably, with the plastic bag ban in New York City and the popularity of reusable straws, environmental consciousness has become very popular. For many years now, scientists have warned us that it may soon be too late to turn back the clock. There is a general consensus that <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/will-it-soon-be-too-late-to-save-the-climate/a-49889771">once the earth’s temperature rises more than 1.5 degrees higher than it was in the industrial age, the effects of climate change will be irreversible</a>.  However, the estimate on when we will hit that mark varies wildly. According to an analysis by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) done in 2018, we will reach that mark somewhere between 2030 and 2052. The countdown on the right represents the time left for us to make a change, before the IPCC’s conservative estimate of 2052. </p>

			<p> Evidently, we must act soon. Getting rid of plastic bags and plastic straws is not enough to make the kind of drastic change necessary to save the environment. We are responsible for not only our carbon footprint, but also lowering the carbon footprint of large companies. It is often quoted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change">just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions</a>. How can we hold these companies accountable for their actions? We can do so through the proxy of environmental organizations. By taking the steps to reduce our own carbon footprint, as well as donating to organizations which will hold big corporations accountable we can make a change and hopefully, save the planet. </p>
