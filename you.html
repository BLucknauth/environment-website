				<p> Often, I hear the argument that one person cannot make a difference in the face of big companies being responsible for so much of global emissions. <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/so-you-think-corporations-are-responsible-for-the-worlds-emissions-its-not-that-simple">Not only is that somewhat of a misunderstanding</a>, consumers are not entirely free from blame as we are the ones who purchase from and thus keep those corporations alive. If consumer trends shift towards environmentally friendly objects, ideally by the nature of the free market, corporations must follow. For example, in the wake of controversy against plastic straws and their effects on sea turtles, <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2018/starbucks-to-eliminate-plastic-straws-globally-by-2020/">Starbucks has begun using paper straws globally</a>. So what are some ways that you can make a difference?</p>

				<h3> 1. Ditch Fast Fashion</h3>
				<p> The fast fashion industry is often quoted as the second largest polluter in the world. Although <a href="https://www.racked.com/2017/3/15/14842476/fashion-climate-change-environment-pollution">this fact cannot be attributed to any source</a> and seems dubious, we can be certain that even if the fashion industry is not the second largest polluter in the world it is certainly up there. The clothes you’re wearing right now are probably plastic! Polyester, nylon, and acrylic are just some of the fabrics that contain plastic. Of course, once the life cycle of our clothes are up, that plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, not to mention that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43023-x#:~:text=Microplastic%20pollution%20caused%20by%20washing,primary%20microplastics%20in%20the%20oceans.&text=A%20great%20amount%20of%20microfibres,a%20blend%20of%20polyester%2Fcellulose">microplastics are released into water every time you wash them.</a> Even natural materials like cotton have the environmental ramifications of the conditions it took to produce the fabric. </p>

				<p>So what can we do? The best solution seems to be buying staple pieces that will remain in our wardrobes for substantial amounts of time, instead of renewing our wardrobes each season and creating more waste and pollution. Thus, consider investing in high quality and sustainably made clothing. However it is important to remain vigilant against greenwashing, as <a href="https://www.eco-stylist.com/we-tested-everlane-and-they-failed/">Everlane came under recent controversy for doing</a>. This can be of course simplified by buying clothes secondhand. However, if buying clothes secondhand isn’t your style, check out <a href="https://directory.goodonyou.eco">Good On You</a> for a range of ratings on numerous fashion brands. It helpfully rates fashion companies on their environmental impact as well as their price range! </p>

				<h3> 2. Go Vegan (or Vegetarian)!</h3>
				<p> It can be difficult to change our diets our diets in terms of finances or health! In the nature of small actions being able to help the environment even a change as small as having one vegan/vegetarian day a week where you otherwise would not have been can make a difference.</p>

				<p>Livestock is estimated to be responsible for <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/">14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. The grain currently fed to livestock takes a huge toll on the environment. This can be circumvented <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meat-and-environment/">by eating plant based meals</a>. By making the decision to go vegetarian as infrequently as one day a week, or one week every other month, you can reduce your own impact on the environment via the meat industry. Almond milk has a reputation of being bad for the environment, but <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46654042">ALL plant-based milks are better for the environment than dairy</a> in terms of emissions, land use, and water use! </p>

				<h3> 3. Ditch Single Use Plastics </h3>
				<p> This one is a given but we use a lot more plastic than just plastic bags and straws. Plastic water/soft drink bottles, ziploc bags, and disposable cutlery are just a few of the plastics we could easily with reusable options. Even single use food packaging can be avoided by shopping in the bulk section of your local supermarket (and bringing your own jar!) Over the course of just one day take time to be aware of how much plastic you use with the intention to throw out immediately or eventually and search for more sustainable alternatives when possible! </p>
